# Spaceship Shooters

## About The Project

"Spaceship Shooters" is a 2D arcade style minigame with spaceships I built in Python to learn more about the Pygame library. Two players can play this game with the WASD keys and Arrow keys. The objective is to simply fire the opposite player with lasers and deplete their health points.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

- Python (The version used for development was [v3.9.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3912/).)
- Pygame
  ```sh
  pip install pygame
  ```
  > Try using "pip3" instead of "pip", if you're having issues with installing Pygame.
